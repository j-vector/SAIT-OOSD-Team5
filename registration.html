            <p>This page will allow a customer to set up an account with Travel Experts by entering their name, address (including city, province, country, and postal code), email address, home phone number, business phone number, user ID, and password, which will be used, after verifcatin, to establish an account for future orders. The data will be submitted to a test page (use bouncer.php) at this point, but this page will be enhanced later to become an order page with server-side scripting and database access.</p>
